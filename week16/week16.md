##### a)

Explain what information is stored in an ARP table

##### b)

Consider a local area network consisting of three hosts with IP and MAC addresses as specified in the figure below and a switch with interfaces numbered 1-3 as specified in the figure. Assume that the ARP tables on all hosts are empty and that the switch-table on the switch is empty.

![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20200409164038903.png)

What is the content of the ARP table on the host with IP address 112.223.334.1 after an IP datagram from 112.223.334.1 to 112.223.334.3 has been sent? **Justify your answer**

##### c)

What will the content of the switch-table be after an IP datagram from 112.223.334.1 to 112.223.334.3 has been sent? **Justify your answer**
